React.js Sidebar App Documentation
==================================

Overview
--------

This React.js app implements a sidebar navigation with a dark mode feature. It consists of a Sidebar component (`Sidebar.js`) and its corresponding CSS file (`Sidebar.css`). The sidebar displays a logo, name, and profession along with a list of menu items. Users can toggle the sidebar, switch between light and dark modes, and select different menu options.

Sidebar Component (`Sidebar.js`)
--------------------------------

The `Sidebar` component is the main component responsible for rendering the sidebar navigation. It uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the sidebar and dark mode.

### State

The component uses the `sidebarOpen` state to keep track of whether the sidebar is open or closed. It starts with the initial state of `false`.

### Functions

1.  `toggleSidebar()`: This function is called when the user clicks on the toggle arrow icon. It toggles the value of `sidebarOpen`, thereby opening or closing the sidebar.
    
2.  `toggleDarkMode()`: This function is called when the user clicks on the dark mode switch. It toggles the dark mode for the app by adding or removing the `dark` class to the `body` element.
    

### Sidebar Structure

The `render()` method of the `Sidebar` component returns the JSX structure representing the sidebar. It consists of the following elements:

1.  `nav`: The top-level `nav` element that wraps the entire sidebar.
2.  `header`: The header section containing the logo, name, and profession.
3.  `div.menu-bar`: The container for the navigation menu items and dark mode switch.

#### Sidebar Menu

The navigation menu is rendered using the `SidebarItems` array, which contains menu items defined in the `list.js` file. Each menu item is represented by a `li` element containing an anchor (`a`) tag. The anchor tag includes an icon and the title of the menu item.

### CSS Styles (`Sidebar.css`)

The `Sidebar.css` file contains the styling for the sidebar and dark mode feature. It defines variables for colors and transitions used in the app. The CSS classes and styles are organized to style different components of the sidebar.

#### Dark Mode

The CSS includes styles for the dark mode feature. When the `body` element has the class `dark`, the app's colors are changed to create a dark mode user interface.
